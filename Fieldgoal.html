	 	   <li> Worth 3 points 
		   <ul> This is not as much as a touchdown, but it is still  valuable, and has lead to countless wins for the teams that score them. </ul>
		   </li>
	 	   <li> Scored by kicking the ball throught the uprights 
		   <ul> As shown above, a field goal is scored by kicking the ball thropugh a tall, U shaped structure. Thi is usually done from 40-60 yards away, making it incredibly difficult for anyone but the best kickers on the planet. </ul>
		   </li>
		   <li> Only attempted if someone can't score a touchdown, or runs out of time 
		   <ul> Because they are worth less than touchdowns, field goals are only attempted when a team can't score a touchdown. This is usually due to it being 4th down, or the time in the game running out. </ul>
		   </li>
		   <li> Can only be achieved by the offense 
			   <ul> Contrary to touchdowns, field goals can only be scored by the offense, because they take up their own play, and require the kicker to be on the field. </ul>
