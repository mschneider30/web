				</li>
	   		<li> Scored by entering the endzone 
				<ul> As shown below, this is done not by a players body entering the endzone, but by the ball entering. </ul>
			</li>

			<li> Most Common Method 
			<ul> This is more common than any other score in football. This is due to it being the offense's first priority. </ul>
			</li>
			<li> Usually scored by offense, but can be achieved on defense after a interception or a fumble 
			<ul> If the defense intercepts a pass, or recovers a fumble, it is allowed to run the ball ito the endzone. If this is done they earn their team 7 points. However, this is quite rare and usually doesn't happen. </ul>
